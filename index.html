        <p>
          I have a background in Nuclear and Energy Technology Engineering, complemented by a Master's degree in Engineering Physics specializing in Plasma Physics. Additionally, I earned a Ph.D. in Metallurgical Sciences and Materials Science, focusing on the characterization and synthesis of ceramic materials using techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Infrared Spectroscopy, DSC, TGA, and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Throughout my career, I've showcased a passion for education and a commitment to contributing to the academic community. I've always been enthusiastic about solving mathematical problems and possess a deep understanding of numeric data manipulation. My skills in data analysis have evolved throughout my academic journey, during which I conducted research associated with processing extensive amounts of numeric data. My desire to enhance my data processing skills led me to undertake various courses in Python, Power BI, SQL, and R. I've completed courses offered by prestigious institutions like Harvard, IBM, and Universitat Politècnica de València.
